	I am sure you have questions as to how I created this site. It all began with an idea-as I was not going to be taking engineering classes for a semester, how could I maintain my skills as a softwarhe result was this web page, written using a coding language called "HTML" and formatted using another language called "CSS". Here you will find all of the notes I wrote while creating this site. They are in English, for my studies are done in English and I found the information in English, so you do not need to worry about needing to translate anything!
